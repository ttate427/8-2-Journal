Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to experience multiple roles within the Agile Scrum framework, including Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developer. Each role offered a different perspective and helped me better understand how Agile teams function in a real-world environment. As the Product Owner, I was responsible for defining the vision for the SNHU Travel application and creating user stories that outlined what the end users needed. This required thinking critically about what the client would want and ensuring each story was clear and actionable. One example was the story centered around booking travel packages. I made sure it was detailed enough for developers to understand what the feature needed to do, while still keeping the user’s goals in focus.

Acting as the Scrum Master allowed me to take on more of a leadership and facilitation role. I helped structure the sprint planning process, set timeboxes for development, and made sure any obstacles were addressed so that the team could stay productive. While this was a simulated team environment, the experience helped me understand the importance of keeping lines of communication open and regularly checking in on progress. When I was in the Developer role, I took the user stories and broke them down into manageable tasks, focusing on creating functional sections of the travel app in short iterations. Being responsible for coding and testing small pieces at a time made the project feel less overwhelming and showed me the value of building software in small, testable chunks.

The use of Agile Scrum made it easier to complete user stories and maintain focus. Working in short sprints helped me concentrate on one goal at a time rather than trying to develop the entire project all at once. For example, one sprint was dedicated entirely to setting up the user login and profile management feature. Because the sprint was tightly focused, I was able to design, build, and test those features without distractions, which helped reduce bugs and improved the overall quality of the software. By the time the next sprint started, I could confidently move on to the next set of stories without backtracking too much.

Interruptions and changes are inevitable in any project, and I found that Agile handled them far better than traditional models like Waterfall. In one case, the user’s needs for the booking flow changed slightly mid-sprint, requiring an adjustment to the way results were displayed. Because the Agile process encourages regular reviews and retrospectives, it was easy to shift the updated feature into the next sprint and reprioritize tasks accordingly. If this project had been managed using a Waterfall approach, the change would likely have disrupted the entire project timeline and pushed back delivery.

Communication was a key factor in keeping the project on track. Even though this wasn’t a live team setting, I made sure to simulate daily stand-ups, log progress, and reflect on blockers. For example, noting that I was “blocked on user login testing due to an unresolved database connection” helped identify what needed to be fixed and how to move forward. These short, focused updates helped keep things moving and created a clear record of what was happening throughout each sprint. Writing these updates—even for myself—showed me how important transparency and status visibility are in team-based software projects.

I relied on a task board to organize and visualize all my stories, tasks, and sprint goals. Whether it was Trello or a simple spreadsheet, having a space where I could map out what needed to be done, what was in progress, and what was completed kept me organized and motivated. I also made time for retrospectives at the end of each sprint to reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. These moments of reflection helped me adjust priorities, refine workflows, and build better habits moving forward.

The overall Agile process had many advantages, especially for a project like this one. Being able to release small, working parts of the application quickly meant that I could test them earlier and make improvements based on feedback, rather than waiting until the end. Agile’s flexibility made it easy to incorporate changes and address problems as they came up. That said, Agile isn’t perfect—it does require constant communication and can feel overwhelming with all the frequent meetings and updates. But compared to Waterfall, where everything is rigidly structured from the beginning, Agile felt more in tune with the way real-world development often works.

In the end, working through this simulated project using Agile Scrum helped me build a deeper appreciation for iterative development, strong communication, and flexible planning. Being able to step into different roles gave me a clearer picture of how cross-functional teams collaborate and deliver high-quality products. I believe this experience has not only helped me understand the Agile process better but has also prepared me to work effectively in fast-paced, ever-changing environments where client needs evolve and quick delivery is a priority.

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
To interpret user needs, I start by carefully gathering information through interviews, surveys, or observations. It is important to distinguish between what users say they want and what they actually need to solve their problem effectively. Once the needs are identified, I translate them into specific features that the program should include and clear requirements that the program must follow. After organizing and prioritizing these needs, I implement them into the program by building solutions that are focused on addressing the most critical user problems first.

2. How does creating "user stories" help with this?
Creating user stories helps bridge the gap between what the user needs and what the development team builds. A user story is a short, simple statement written from the user’s point of view, usually following the format: "As a [user type], I want to [do something] so that [I achieve some value]." By writing user stories, I can ensure that every feature directly supports a real user goal, making development more focused and efficient. User stories also help organize and prioritize tasks, making it easier to track progress and adjust based on user feedback.

3. How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I first focus on clearly understanding the problem that needs to be solved. I define who the users are and why they need the program. After that, I break down the solution into smaller, manageable tasks or features. I believe in an iterative approach, where I build small parts of the program, test them, gather feedback, and continuously improve. I also focus on creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) first, which means building the simplest, functional version of the program before adding more features or complexity.

4. What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In my future development work, I hope to incorporate several Agile processes. I would like to work in sprints, using Scrum to structure my work into focused, time-boxed periods. I plan to hold daily standups, even if informal, to stay aligned on priorities. After each sprint or major phase, I want to conduct retrospectives to reflect on what went well and what could improve. I also plan to regularly groom my backlog, ensuring tasks are up to date and prioritized based on new information or feedback. Finally, I aim to practice continuous integration by building and testing my code frequently to catch and fix problems early.

5. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means communicating clearly and frequently, especially when encountering challenges. It involves being reliable by following through on commitments or asking for help early if needed. Good team members are adaptable when project goals or technical requirements change. They also give and receive feedback respectfully, focusing on improving the project and supporting their teammates. Overall, a strong team member prioritizes the success of the team and the project over personal credit, contributing wherever needed to help everyone succeed.
